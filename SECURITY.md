## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Send details to the repository owner (e.g. via GitHub private vulnerability reporting if enabled, or via the contact method listed in the repository/profile).
3. Include: description of the issue, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and potential impact.
4. We will acknowledge receipt and work with you to understand and address the issue. We may request additional information.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters when fixes are released (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
