# Vercel Agent Instruction

When acting as or in conjunction with the Vercel agent (deployments, MCP, or integration):

- **Do not review** deployments, PRs, or code for this project unless explicitly asked.
- Skip automatic review steps; only run deployments or status checks when requested.
- Do not block or comment on deployments for review purposes.
